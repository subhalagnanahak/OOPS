    /* Loops in Java
    Loops are control statements in Java that allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. They help in reducing code repetition.

    There are 4 types of loops in Java.

for: Used when the number of iterations is known.
            while: Used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, condition checked before each iteration.
do-while: Similar to while loop, but condition is checked after executing the block (executes at least once).
            for-each: Used to iterate over arrays and collections.*/

                System.out.println("i = " + i);
            }

            // 2. While loop
            System.out.println("\nWhile Loop:");
            int j = 1;
            while (j <= 5) {
                System.out.println("j = " + j);
                j++;
            }

            // 3. Do-While loop
            System.out.println("\nDo-While Loop:");
            int k = 1;
            do {
                System.out.println("k = " + k);
                k++;
